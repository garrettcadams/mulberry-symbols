## Background and vision

Garry Paxton originally conceived of and created the symbols and made them available via his Straight Street website and funded as a charity. In 2018 Garry passed copyright over to Steve Lee.

* Designed to overcome high costs experienced by symbols users - free at point of use
* Foster innovation by allowing reuse and derivations, including internationalisation
* Adult oriented symbols - most proprietary sets are designed for children
* Unusual symbols usually missing from proprietary sets
* Designed by graphics artists, reviewed by SLTs and coloured by people with mental health issues
